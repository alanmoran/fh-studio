fhc is extremely configurable\.  It reads its configuration options from
5 places\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Command line switches:
.
.br
Set a config with \fB\-\-key val\fR\|\.  All keys take a value, even if they
are booleans (the config parser doesn\'t know what the options are at
the time of parsing\.)  If no value is provided, then the option is set
to boolean \fBtrue\fR\|\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Environment Variables:
.
.br
Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with \fBfhc_config_\fR\|\.  For example, \fBexport fhc_config_key=val\fR\|\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
User Configs:
.
.br
The file at $HOME/\.fhcrc is an ini\-formatted list of configs\.  If
present, it is parsed\.  If the \fBuserconfig\fR option is set in the cli
or env, then that will be used instead\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Global Configs:
.
.br
The file found at \.\./etc/fhcrc (from the node executable, by default
this resolves to /usr/local/etc/fhcrc) will be parsed if it is found\.
If the \fBglobalconfig\fR option is set in the cli, env, or user config,
then that file is parsed instead\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Defaults:
.
.br
fhc\'s default configuration options are defined in
lib/utils/config\-defs\.js\.  These must not be changed\.
